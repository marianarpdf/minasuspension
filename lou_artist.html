      <h2>Lou Drago</h2></div>
      Perpetually obsessed with proving the futility of binaries, Lou Drago is drawn to the spaces between analogue and synthesised sounds. They draw inspiration from everything between sci-fi futurities and primitive pasts. In their sets Lou Drago aims to provide a space for contemplation and introspection, offering a pause from the anxiety of neoliberalism through ambient, strange and relaxing sounds. They host a monthly show on Cashmere Radio based in Berlin called TRANSIENCE, each time inviting a different artist to respond to their concept to create an hour of anxiety relief from hetero-patriarchial systems of oppression.<br>
<br>
This concept was inspired in part by Mark Fisher’s writings and from a shared position of feeling as someone failing to fit within a patriarchal neoliberalist mould and the resulting loss of hope in the future. Like much of the Left, Drago concurs that capitalism is not working but cannot yet envisage an alternative. The stability we were instructed to obtain, whether it be financial, political or ecological, feels unrealistic. The resulting anxiety can be interpreted as an instrument of neoliberalism that can prevent many of us from being able to communicate with others to raise consciousness of the structural injustices that alienate us. In a society where security feels no longer feasible the only constant we can rely on is change. In Meeting the Universe Halfway, Karen Barad teaches us that the world is a dynamic process of intra-activity and materialisation, an ongoing ebb and flow of agency. The Buddhist Law of Impermanence maintains that nothing in this world is eternal. Both of these points of reference have lead Drago to understand that every aspect of life, physical and mental, is in flux and perhaps this transience is the only thing we can depend on.
