  <div class="bio"><div id="artistfont"><h2>marum</h2></div><br>
  marum is based in Berlin but a considerable part of the cultural and artistic activity directed by him happens in Lisbon. In 2010 he founded the Rabbit Hole collective, a cultural association that very quickly left a mark on the Portuguese capital by showcasing disruptive artistic production in the fields of performance, installation, DJing, concerts and other disciplines. In music, the influence of minimalistic composers, movie scores and smoke­filled raves are behind his love for hypnotic, acid and industrial techno.<br>
<br>
In 2016 he gathers elements of the Rabbit Hole and Rádio Quântica crews to create what would become one of Lisbon's most talked about parties in recent years: mina. The party was conceived to be a queer, feminist and sex­positive techno rave with a strict door policy and a few simple rules that assure civility and respect for dancing bodies in the name of the original spirit of rave. At Quântica, marum does the monthly show VANTABLACK where he shares his latest musical finds as well as guest mixes and talks about club culture.<br>
<br>
He has played at various parties and raves and radios, highlights of which are Cicciolina (Folies Pigalle, Paris), QRECLAIM (Communitism, Athens), Stock5 (Rote Sonne, Munich), Herrensauna (OHM, Berlin), Lecken (Untertage, Berlin), Room 4 Resistance (://about blank, Berlin), Red Light Radio (Amsterdam), playing in venues such as Institute fur Zukunft (Leipzig), Lux (Lisbon), Maus Hábitos (Porto), Éden (Riode Janeiro) and sharing bills with the likes of Antigone, Pandora's Jukebox, CEM, Haruka, Morah, madalba, among others.
