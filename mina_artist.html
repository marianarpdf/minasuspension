      <h2>BLEID</h2>
      BLEID is an electronic music project and DJ who focuses their work on playing around with notions of genre and speed.<br><br>
      Their two releases out, a self titled tape on Labareda (BLEID [2017]) and an EP done in collaboration with Violet on Naive (Badness [2018]), span through ambient, broken beats and dance floor oriented music, while their mixes for Cómeme, Hypnotic Groove and several online radios explore narratives of ever-changing moods for people to move their body’s to.<br><br>
      Involved in some of Lisbon’s most exciting projects, BLEID is a familiar “face” at Príncipe Discos’ club nights, a resident at feminist forward thinking techno party mina and host Dismantle on Rádio Quântica every month while playing around Europe in festivals like Hyperreality (AT), Creepy Teepee (CZ) and Out.Fest (PT).<br>

  <h2>marum</h2>
marum is based in Berlin but a considerable part of the cultural and artistic activity directed by them happens in Lisbon. In 2010, marum founded the Rabbit Hole collective, a cultural association that very quickly left a mark on the Portuguese capital by showcasing disruptive artistic production in the fields of performance, installation, DJing, concerts and other disciplines.<br><br>
In 2016 marum gathers elements of the Rabbit Hole and Rádio Quântica crews to create what would become one of Lisbon's most talked about parties in recent years: mina. The party was conceived to be a queer, feminist and sex-positive techno rave with a strict door policy and a few simple rules that assure civility and respect for dancing bodies in the name of the original spirit of rave. At Quântica, marum does the monthly show VANTABLACK where he shares their latest musical finds as well as guest mixes and talks about club culture.<br><br>
Parallel to DJing, marum is also a visual and performance artist, curator and writer, focusing their work in the intersections of gender, queer and feminist politics with digital technologies and cultures, having particularly focused on surveillance and capture technologies, cybernetics, clubbing culture and alien phenomenology. In 2016, marum initiated the experimental platform XenoEntities Network,  collaborating with various museums, galleries and art spaces internationally.<br>

  <h2>NA O MI</h2>
NA  O  MI is  a  Lisbon-based  DJ.  One  of  the  residents  of  mina,  a  techno  underground  club  night  in  Lisbon  for  gender  liberation.  She's  also  the  curator  of  the  monthly  radio  show  Desastre  at  Rádio  Quântica,  where  under  various  alter-egos,  tried  to  work  on  the  idea  of  suspending  identity  as  the  starting  point  for  a  possible  existential  liberation.<br><br><br>

  <h2>Photonz</h2>
  Photonz is the main musical alias of Marco Rodrigues ­ a Portuguese DJ and producer that in recent years became a driving force for Lisbon's much talked about underground scene. For little over a decade now, he's been crafting his own deeply personal style of eerie yet potent machine funk for cult imprints such as Créme Organization, 20:20 Vision, Don't Be Afraid, Skylax, Unknown To The Unknown or Príncipe. <br>
<br>
As a DJ, Photonz grew a reputation for deep crates and intensely euphoric sets and in 2017, together with Violet (co­founder at his Radio Quantica) and Lisbon's own Rabbit Hole collective, he started the now infamous mina parties ­ a monthly, sex­positive, queer and intersectional­feminist techno party aimed at using the dissociative potential of intense raving to create a temporary space of suspension away from patriarchal expectations.<br>

  <h2>VIEGAS</h2>
  Born in the suburbs of Lisbon, VIEGAS got his first contact with electronic music through African kuduro. The crudeness and rawness of the sound influenced a lot of his views on what would make him interested in dance music. <br>
<br>
One of the founding members of mina, he started DJing at Portuguese forward thinking Rabbit Hole parties a couple years ago, where he was introduced to a darker, heavier and more mental shade of techno. Later he would join Radio Quântica and start his own show Mercúrio.<br>
<br>
Having played at some of the most cultish electronic music houses in Lisbon and Porto (like Galeria Zé dos Bois, Maus Hábitos and Lux Frágil), his sets reflect the tension between ghetto sounds, industrial metals, ebm nostalgia and a natural curiosity to keep discovering and adding variety to the mix.<br><br><br>

  <h2>Violet</h2>
  The alter-ego of Lisbon DJ and producer Inês Coutinho, is already a well-known resident of mina.<br>
Besides her productions and remixes for labels like One Eyed Jacks label, Cómeme, Paraíso or Snuff Trax since 2012, this year she founded her own imprint naive. She is also the co-founder of Rádio Quântica, an independent, online radio station.<br>
<br>
A politically-charged vision of dance music is present in her artistic gestures, most famously her series of versions of classic tracks released on International Womens' Day in collaboration with artists from around the world with proceeds going to gender equality NGOs. In 2017, she got an even bigger crew of artists together and they re-wrote ‘I Need A Freak’ by Sexual Harrassment, ‘Promised Land’ by Joe Smooth and ‘So Get Up’ by Underground Sound of Lisbon.<br>
<br>
Violet’s DJ sets create sonic journeys that embrace early Chicago house, abrasive techno, mutant jack beats and her own melodic, percussive productions and made her a regular choice at clubs and festivals across Europe. She also runs DJ workshops for femmes, queer and non-binary people.

  <h2>ketia</h2>
  A renaissance girl in her own right, ketia is a DJ, a producer, an activist and a party promoter - and one of the most active new artists on the Lisbon scene. A hardcore raver at heart. A keen ear for new and exciting music, alongside a curious, invested approach to community-building within Lisbon's music scene are key to her short but fruitful path in music so far.<br>
<br>
It's been less than a year since her first-ever performance as a DJ at the infamous queer techno party mina (a crew she is a part of), and ever since she has been more committed than most underground players to creating safer spaces. For example, by founding Kit Ket - a collective and a party that prioritises the safety and inclusion of womxn and non-binary people, where she is also a resident. K//HOLE is her monthly show at Rádio Quântica where ketia, either side by side with her guests or flying solo, finds solace in a delicate sensibility she believed lost through drones, ambient and beyond.<br>
