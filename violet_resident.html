  <div class="bio"><div id="artistfont"><h2>Violet</h2></div>
    The alter-ego of Lisbon DJ and producer Inês Coutinho, is already a well-known resident of mina.<br>
Besides her productions and remixes for labels like One Eyed Jacks label, Cómeme, Paraíso or Snuff Trax since 2012, this year she founded her own imprint naive. She is also the co-founder of Rádio Quântica, an independent, online radio station.<br>
<br>
A politically-charged vision of dance music is present in her artistic gestures, most famously her series of versions of classic tracks released on International Womens' Day in collaboration with artists from around the world with proceeds going to gender equality NGOs. In 2017, she got an even bigger crew of artists together and they re-wrote ‘I Need A Freak’ by Sexual Harrassment, ‘Promised Land’ by Joe Smooth and ‘So Get Up’ by Underground Sound of Lisbon.<br>
<br>
Violet’s DJ sets create sonic journeys that embrace early Chicago house, abrasive techno, mutant jack beats and her own melodic, percussive productions and made her a regular choice at clubs and festivals across Europe. She also runs DJ workshops for femmes, queer and non-binary people.
